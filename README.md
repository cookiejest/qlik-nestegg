# qlik-nestegg

This is a standalone desktop tool that works with Qlik Sense Desktop to let you create mocha tests for Qlik Sense.

Main use cases:

1) Validate numbers that are loaded into an app are within an expected range.



#Why did this get built?

In all honesty I was looking for an excuse to use electron to build a desktop app and this was something that automated away some manual testing people were doing at work. 

Not much more too it really.
